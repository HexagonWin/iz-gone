                    <p>“My diary becomes a fairy tale with your magic”<br />IZ*ONE’s 3rd mini album, Oneiric Diary, is a concept album that portrays both “elegant charisma” and “girl next door image” of IZ*ONE members, expressed through a combination of two opposing themes of “fantasy” and “diary”.</p>
                    <p>It tells a story of how the fairy-tale-like diary entries written by 12 girls come true through magical power. The songs in the album, which are unique in their own ways, are unified under the common theme of “oneiric diary” and form an integrated whole.</p>
                    <p>“I dance for you, I dream with you”<br />The title song “Secret Story of the Swan” is a cinematic EDM which expresses the multifaceted beauty of the 12 IZ*ONE members. It shows IZ*ONE as heroines in the fairy tale they have held dear to their hearts.</p>
                    <p>The song also delivers an encouraging message that all dreams can come true. It’s a track like a movie that showcases unparalleled performances and charm that are unique to IZ*ONE.</p>

                    <p>“You’re so pretty just the way you are!”<br />“Pretty” is a cute and bright dance song that sends a message to those who have a dream. In “Merry-Go-Round”, a merry-go-round is used as a metaphor for the beautiful moments in a dream that one does not wish to end. “Rococo” is a song that expresses IZ*ONE’s intention to create a dream-like new world. Finally, “With*One” is a fan song with lyrics written by all IZ*ONE members who wanted to show their desire to comfort the fans who were going through hard times and be by their side.</p>​
                    <p>With diverse genres and lyrics, [Oneiric Diary] contains IZ*ONE’s unique set of diverse characteristics and communicates their support for everyone’s dreams throughout the album with the message that dreams do come true.</p>

                    <p>IZ*ONE finally comes back with their first studio album [BLOOM*IZ] on February 17 and aim for a three-hit home run with the title song ‘FIESTA’.</p>
                    <p>Following the 2018 Korean debut album [COLOR*IZ], the 2nd mini album, [HEART*IZ], released last April, topped both domestic and international charts as well as breaking the first record of its own. IZ*ONE proved their global presence with their sold out ‘EYES ON ME’ tour, garnering more than 80,000 people in 8 overseas regions, and now continues to prove their boundless growth with their confirmed comeback after a 10-month hiatus. </p>
                    <p>IZ*ONE’s first studio album, [BLOOM*IZ], is a combination of the words “bloom” and “IZ*ONE.” The album expresses the twelve members at their peak of beauty, who are ready to be in full bloom, in various ways.</p>
                    <p>In particular, [BLOOM*IZ] is a meaningful album, as it wraps up the “FLOWER series,” which included “La Vie en Rose” and “Violeta.” By enduring growing pains and putting effort into their goals, this album represents IZ*ONE’s infinite potential and their diverse talent. It’s now time to finally reach their dreams that are beautifully blooming.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="column column-right one-half">
	                <p>Furthermore, the title track, “FIESTA,” as the name implies, is expressed in a bold and glamorous manner through the image of “festivals,” depicting IZ*ONE as a group in their full bloom. If the strong passion of “La Vie en Rose” met with the lovely “Violeta” to express the group’s radiant future, “FIESTA” represents the effort to make their once dreamed of future into reality.</p>
	                <p>In addition, the full group tracks, “EYES,” “SPACESHIP,” “DESTINY,” “YOU & I,” “OPEN YOUR EYES,” along with the diverse unit tracks, “DREAMLIKE,” “AYAYAYA,” “SO CURIOUS,” “DAYDREAM,” “PINK BLUSHER,” and “SOMEDAY” filled with IZ*ONE’s mature voices enrich the track list of their first studio album.</p>
	                <p>In order to shine light on this long-awaited moment, IZ*ONE has finally blossomed through magnificent colors. With genuine hopes to fulfill their dream, IZ*ONE aims to soar higher than ever with their first studio album [BLOOM*IZ].</p>

                            <p>From bright to dark, calm to powerful, the various arrangements of the track flexibly represent the diversity of the 12 members of IZ*ONE.</p>

                            <p>The future house genre track consists of rhythmic bass sounds with a mysterious yet intense synth sound, giving off a trendy vibe with a deep melody. The contrast of the fast-paced harmonization and grandeur sound provides a fresh perspective to listeners.</p>

                    <p>Since their debut in 2018, IZ*ONE has been building global momentum by topping domestic and international charts, winning 1st place on music broadcasts, and taking home 5 rookie awards. IZ*ONE announced their comeback with the second mini-album &#60;HEART*IZ&#62; for release on April 1st.</p>
                    <p>Following the release of their Korean debut album &#60;COLOR*IZ&#62; last October, Japan’s debut single &#60;Suki to Iwasetai&#62; sold 220,000 copies upon release, as well as taking 1st place on Japan’s renowned daily singles chart shortly after release. After making a successful entry into both Korea and Japan’s music scene, IZ*ONE comes back after six months with their second mini-album &#60;HEART*IZ&#62; to set new records and expand their global bartprint.</p>
                    <p>Trailing the successful release of IZ*ONE’s last debut album, producer Han Sung Soo reunited once again for the highly anticipated album &#60;HEART*IZ&#62;. The title of &#60;HEART*IZ&#62; is a compound word with 'Heart' and 'IZ*ONE,' representing love and affection which conveys IZ*ONE's sincere stories in the album. With the participation of members in the writing of select songs, a more profound musical sense as an artist can be observed. </p>
                    <p>Adding to the intensity of IZ*ONE's passion previously shown through 'La Vie en Rose,' HEART*IZ was born with further love and encouragement. While the last debut album compared their passion to a 'rose,' this album aims to deliver IZ*ONE's heartfelt message of encouragement to all listeners and fans alike. Particularly, the song 'Violeta' is a cheerful song that hopes to repay the love and energy received from the public and all fans.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="column column-right one-half">
                    <p>In addition, the title track ‘Violeta’ was partially inspired by the fairytale, ‘The Happy Prince.’, ‘Violeta,’ represents the violet flower, which resembles all the people the members wish to encourage, while IZ*ONE represent the ‘swallow’ which delivers the ‘sapphire,’ representing happiness, to those in need. Thus the reinterpretation holds a message of encouragement that every individual is a shining light just by their pure existence.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, this album is full of positive energy with tracks like 'Hey. Bae. Like it,’ 'Highlight' which is an extension of the song 'Violeta' depicting IZ*ONE’s superb charm, ‘Really Like You,’ a friendship-themed track expressing genuine feels for each other, ‘Airplane,’ illustrating IZ*ONE’s future and stage through the comparison of a grand sky, and lastly 'Up' which is a song of affection dedicated to all fans.</p>
                    <p>As the album &#60;HEART*IZ&#62; begins with a ‘flower’ and transitions into the ‘sky,’ each track is interconnected with one another. When listening in a sequential order, IZ*ONE's heartfelt love and message for WIZ*ONE can be felt, as well as the direction that they wish to continue as a group. </p>
                    <p>Moreover, the tracks ‘NEKONI NARITAI’ and ‘GOKIGEN SAYONARA,’ from the Japanese debut single, 'Suki to Iwasetai,' released in February last year, were newly adapted and reborn. As a 12-member unit version, the tracks add a finishing touch to the album which illustrates the unique voice and sensibility of IZ*ONE.</p>

                            <p>‘Hey. Bae. Like it’ is based on the internationally rising genre, Afro House, which is marked by tense analog synthesizers, African percussion rhythms, and brass which enhance the overall sophisticated mood of the song. Further to note, IZ*ONE delivers feel-good energy through their lovely vocals and warmth.</p>
                            <p>Starting from the intro, the calming voice of members as well as MIYAWAKI SAKURA’s cute ad-lib come together to heighten the refreshing charm of the track.</p>

                            <p>The title track, 'Violeta,' was inspired in part by the fairytale, ‘The Happy Prince.’ The intro of the track starts off in a Future Bass genre followed by a combination of POP and Tropical House, which create a harmony to fully express IZ*ONE’s diverse charms and enigmatic energy.</p>
                            <p>In 'Violeta', the violet flower portrays a person that fails to find true happiness whom IZ*ONE loves and comforts at the same time. Thereby, IZ*ONE is reinterpreted as the 'swallow' that delivers the 'sapphire,' which symbolizes happiness, to the violet flower.</p>
                            <p>The title track ‘Violeta’ concludes as a strong narrative which aims to deliver a message in hopes that everyone will realize their precious self-value.</p>

                            <p>As a track that captures the bright and cheerful energy of IZ*ONE, the witty lyrics compare the broad 'sky' with 'IZ*ONE' and their coming future.</p>
                            <p>Hence, IZ*ONE is portrayed as an airplane that freely roams the sky, soaring high up in the air with its wings spread wide just as IZ*ONE is anticipated to rise. It is especially more notable as a song gifted by Lee Dae-hwi from Mnet's survival program ‘Produce 101 Season 2,’ in support of IZ*ONE to soar sky high with their dreams.</p>

                            <p>A track from the Japanese debut single 'Suki to Iwasetai' released in February this year, ‘NEKONI NARITAI’ received much praise from Korean fans. Following this popularity, it was reborn as a 12-member unit track with KIM MIN JU making a new adaptation of the song. It captures the bright and lovely essence of the group, along with their 12-member version of the point choreography cat dance.</p>
                            <p>As a track with relaxed and warm tones, high expectations are further in place from the point choreography which created much buzz with fans.</p>

                            <p>With its addictive chorus, the track gleams of infinite bright energy which has a different appeal when compared with 'NEKONI NARITAI'. As a song which received much love in Korea from the Japanese debut single 'Suki to Iwasetai,' ‘GOKIGEN SAYONARA’ is the ideal ending track to decorate the finale of the album.</p>
                            <p>As a unit track translated by the member LEE CHAE YEON, it carries the message that greetings and farewells are one and the same since both are together through it all. This message is illustrated as a new adaptation track embodying the sincere voice of the members. ‘GOKIGEN SAYONARA’ is well fitted for IZ*ONE’s clear and bright tone, and serves as an example of envisioning the members in a parting situation.</p>
